# Project Overview

This document captures the product purpose, strategic goals, and decisions that cannot change without team agreement. Global technical rules live in `coding_patterns.mdc`.

## Project

- **Name**: [Define here]
- **Purpose**: One sentence describing the problem solved and the target audience.

## Strategic Goals

- Deliver a consistent experience driven by Signals and layered architecture
- Increase productivity using Angular 20 zoneless and Supabase as managed backend
- Prioritize extensibility through isolated modules and concise documentation

## Official Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular 20 (standalone, zoneless)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.4+
- **Backend/DB**: Supabase
- **Tooling**: Nx 21.5.3, npm

## Non-Negotiable Decisions

- Follow global conventions defined in `coding_patterns.mdc`
- Keep the flow `Component → Service → API`; only APIs talk to `SupabaseClient`
- Bootstrap without `NgZone`; exceptions require approval from the technical team
- File, class, and selector names must follow `naming_conventions.mdc`
- Templates must use Angular control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`)

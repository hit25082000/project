# 📂 File Management & Refactoring

### 🚨 THE 1500-LINE MINIMUM READ RULE - THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL
- You MUST read at least 1500 lines of a file before editing it to gain complete context. Do not perform partial reads.
- Once you've read the full file, trust that you understand it. Do not re-read unnecessarily.

### 🚫 CRITICAL FILE RULES
- ****NEVER CREATE NEW FILES**** unless it is a core requirement of the task. Your first instinct must always be to consolidate.
- ****ALWAYS PREFER EDITING EXISTING FILES****. Find the most relevant existing file and add your functionality there.

### 🗑️ THE 10% DELETION REQUIREMENT
- ****EVERY FILE YOU TOUCH MUST GET SMALLER****. Other models add code. You remove it.
- Aggressively find and delete redundancy: unused imports, dead code, debug statements, and over-engineered abstractions.
- If you can't find 10% to delete, you haven't read the file closely enough. Look harder.
